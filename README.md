**Main Folder**
The main folder includes one of the versions of the main code we used. This is not working as of yet, but will be revised soon to be fully functional. The picture included is the *amazing* picture used to test the image generation.

**Side Folder** 
This folder contains other things produced along the way. One of these was a program that accessed the camera and took a picture when the "S" key was pressed. The rest of the files are images made by each different variation of working AI editors.
